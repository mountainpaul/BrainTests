🎮 2. High-level overview of how the test works

PAL is a touchscreen-based test. The participant sees several boxes (usually 2, 4, 6, or 8) arranged around the screen.

General test flow:
	1.	A box opens and briefly shows a simple pattern (visual abstract shape).
	2.	The box closes.
	3.	After all patterns have been shown in their correct boxes, the screen displays one pattern at a time in the center.
	4.	The participant must touch the box where that pattern was originally shown.

The test automatically increases difficulty based on performance.

🔍 3. Step-by-step description of the PAL task

Stage 1 — Familiarization
	•	The participant learns how to tap boxes.
	•	One practice pattern is used.
	•	The purpose is to ensure understanding of the touchscreen interaction.

⸻

Stage 2 — 2-pattern trials
	•	Two boxes appear on the screen. Horizonatal layout
	•	Each box opens briefly and shows one of two patterns.
	•	After a short delay, a pattern appears in the center.
	•	The participant taps the correct box location.

If successful move up to stage 3 trials. 
Repeat up to 3 times
⸻

Stage 3 — 4-pattern trials
	•	Four boxes appear in a  grid. 
	•	Four distinct patterns appear one-by-one in different boxes.
	•	After the learning phase, patterns are tested in random order.

Correct responses → move up to stage 5.
Incorrect responses → the correct layout is replayed.

⸻

Stage 4 — 5-pattern trials

Same as stage 4 but with five patterns and five  boxes. Arranged in a circle

⸻
Stage 5 — 6-pattern trials

Same as stage 5 but with six patterns and six boxes. Arranged in a circle

⸻

Stage 6 — 7-pattern trials (max difficulty)
	•	7 boxes appear around the screen. Arranged in a circle
	•	7 patterns are shown sequentially.
	•	Then the patient must identify all 7 locations correctly.


Stage 7 — 8-pattern trials (max difficulty)
	•	Eight boxes appear around the screen. Arranged in a circle
	•	Eight patterns are shown sequentially.
	•	Then the patient must identify all eight locations correctly.

This is very challenging for older adults or those with memory impairment.
